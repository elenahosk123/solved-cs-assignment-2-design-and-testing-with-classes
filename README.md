Implement that class using object-oriented programming techniques  Overload an operator for a class




You need to design, implement, and test a grocery shopping list program.  The program should maintain and display a list of items.




You will use a class for the Items.   <strong>The class should have data elements for the following information:</strong>  item name, unit (i.e. can, box, pounds, or ounces), number to buy, and unit price.   Do you need any functions other than the constructor(s)?   How do you calculate the extended price for the item (number to buy times unit price?  How do you print it to the screen?




You will also need a List class. <strong>You will store Item objects in your List object.</strong>   As each item is entered an Item object must be created and added to the List object. Use a <strong>dynamic array</strong> to hold the Item objects.  The dynamic array should start with a capacity of 4 Item objects.   Do you need a print function in this class?




NOTE:  A vector is not a dynamic array.




<strong>Your program must perform the following activities</strong>: create a list, add items, remove items, and display the shopping list.  To add an item you should prompt the user to enter the name, unit of sale, the number needed, and the unit price.  <strong>The display should show</strong>:  each item in the list, the number of items, the unit of sale, the unit price, the extended price for each item, and the total price for all items.  Oregon doesnâ€™t have a sales tax so you can ignore that. JJ  Debug and test your program.




Once you have the List and Item classes working correctly, test if an item is already in your List before adding it.  <strong>Overload the == operator to perform the test.</strong>  There is a simple example to overload this operator in the book.  Keep it simple.  How will you compare items?  You can assume that the user will type the information in correctly.




You must create a design document.  It should include the design of the classes and how you will use the classes.  Figure that out, <strong>before</strong> you start coding.  If you do the design properly the coding should be easier.




Your reflections document should include the design document, the testing results, and describe any changes you made to your original design.




You will provide a simple test plan.  Since this is a program with input and output you should not need any driver functions. You do NOT need to test for every possible item in a grocery store, just a reasonable number or varying lengths.  How do you handle spaces in names?   Are the extended prices calculated correctly?  Is the total amount correct?
